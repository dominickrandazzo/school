# How to write your first python program!
Written by: Dominick Randazzo

Today we will be writting a very simple program in python to show the basics of the software. The end product will have the program saying ~~"Hello World!"~~ "What's up!". 
This tutorial is meant for __beginners__ who have just only downloaded python. [If you haven't installed python yet, click on me.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### 1. Creating a new file
To create a new file, click on File in the upper left corner. Then select 'new file'. 
A new pop up will appear and this is where we will be writing our code at. For now lets finalize our new file by saving it. Click on File again in the left upper corner, then select save as.
You can name this program whatever you want, but I recommend just naming it MyFirstProgram.

#### 2. Writing the code
Now to the good stuff. In the program window type in **print("What's Up!")**. You already finished the program, congratulation. You could be done here and move
on to the next step, or we could have a little more fun and make it more interesting. Go ahead and delete everything you just wrote. Type in **words = "What's Up!"**.
Hit enter, then type **print(words)**. We achieved the same end with different means.

#### 3. Running the program
The last step is the easiest so far. At the top of the screen is the word Run, 3 spots over from File. Click that then click Run Module. 
It will ask you to save the program and do so. The original screen will appear and it should say in blue **What's Up!**. You can now either quit both the screens, or 
go back and edit the program some more.
